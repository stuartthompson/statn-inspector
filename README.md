# Statn Inspector

The statn inspector provides information about files that are open in the editor.

## Why does this extension exist?

Partly because I wanted to learn more about building VSCode extensions, but also partly to help me solve a specific problem identifying special characters and to quickly gain information about certain files.

## Features

Information about the file that is being edited.

Honestly, I don't really know yet. I needed a project to learn about how to build VSCode extensions, and an informational panel appealed to me.

## Requirements
